Changelog for Fred.

1.0.0 beta8
==============
- Now with 100% more German. Danke für die Übersetzung.
- Fix HTML generation when saving Fred Resource from the Manager,  which didn't work and was a bummer. Now it's not.
- Show a loading icon when generating Blueprint screenshots. This helps calm user anxiety over "Didn't I just push that button? …" as it can take a few seconds when doing full-page Blueprints.
- Duplicating an image that saved to a TV caused an infinite loop. Inception is good for movies, not for software, so we fixed that.
