#Options

Options are what defines the controls given to end users when configuring Elements. They are defined in an [Option Set](/option_sets), or option override, when creating/updating an Element. The available [options](/option_sets/#available-options) in an Option Set can be used in overrides.

## Option Override
In Create/Edit Element view there's a chance to define one time option set, or override selected option set. The override will adjust only parts of the selected option set and won't affect another elements.
