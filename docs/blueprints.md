# Blueprints

Fred Blueprints can be thought of as a “replace the placeholders” way to create content. They are a collection of one or more—even complete page designs—Elements with sample content already composed. 

They can be as simple as a single headline or paragraph, or more complex like a hero intro with configurable background images, text padding, opacity settings and more.

## Organized by Categories

Elements can be organized to aid content creators in finding different types of content. For example, a Theme might contain the following Element Categories:

- Text
- Intros
- Quotes
- Code Blocks
- Galleries
