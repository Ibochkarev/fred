# Getting Started

The easiest way to start with Fred is installing a Theme created for Fred. 

1. Pick and install a Theme from the [MODX Extras repository](https://modx.com/extras/browse/?search=fred) into your MODX website.
2. Add a new page to your site. Choose one of the Templates from the Theme and save the Page.
3. Click the `Preview` button to visit this page from the front-end to start building with Fred.
