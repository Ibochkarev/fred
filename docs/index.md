# Fred
Fred is a flexible and powerful drag-and-drop **fr**ont-end **ed**itor for MODX CMS. It enables non-technical users to create beautiful content without having to know markup or dealing with overwhelming back-end interfaces. It fully supports MODX Snippets and intuitive controls like sliders and color pickers for configuring content on the page. 

What differentiates Fred from other visual content builders is MODX’s core tenet of Creative Freedom: it doesn’t force you to use one HTML/CSS framework, empowering you to create anything you can imagine. Expand upon or customize a provided starter theme, or create a complete solution from scratch that’s 100% unique to you. 

Since there are _no_ restrictions on markup, templates, or techniques, designers, theme creators, and front-end developers can realize their creative vision with pixel-perfect precision—and can confidently turn over content creation duties to regular end-users without fear of things breaking. Fred leads to amazing websites without requiring designer and developer involvement day-to-day.

## How Fred Works
To build sites with Fred, users drag content “Elements” or “Blueprints” from a sidebar, drop them where desired on a page, and edit the settings and placeholder content without ever having to use a back-end admin tool. Fred’s features combine to make it a powerful visual content builder:

- Transform static Design Libraries into a live content creating tool that strictly adheres to brand standards and that is easily understood and used by non-technical team members across your entire organization
- Use optional conditional/looping Twig template logic to create robust Elements limited only by your imagination
- Create and organize collections of Elements as building blocks for pages
- Blueprints provide “replace the placeholders” full- or partial-page templates
- Multiple dropzones for complete control of every page layout
- Configure content using a variety of controls including toggles, text inputs, date pickers, select inputs, sliders, Resource pickers, and color pickers
- Supports MODX code Snippets with live Ajax rendering of changes
- Visual Font Awesome 5 icon picker—developers can create other icon pickers, too 
- Simple content formatting with a curated default TinyMCE rich text editor
- Rearrange and re-order page content via drag-and-drop
- Quickly duplicate existing elements to build up galleries and sliders
- Fred content renders down to cachable output for blazing-fast page speed
- Complete set of production-ready Bootstrap 4 Elements for theme authors to use as a starting point
